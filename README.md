# Internet of Things Bill of Rights

On September 9th, 2013 - The New York Times asked [Adafruit][1]'s founder and engineer, Limor "Ladyada" Fried to contribute to an article series called **ROOM *for* DEBATE**. The article [can be viewed here][2] and Limor's contribution [can be viewed here][3].

We believe Internet of Things devices should all come with a well established expectation of what they will and will not do with consumer's data. In the article we put together the start of what we hope will help this effort - [Minimizing Risk Is Easy: Adopt a Bill of Rights][3]

A significant difficulty will be Things of Internet which are used and owned by different people.  For example:
* devices in a rented house,
* medical devices,
* leased devices,
* privately-owned devices that interact with the public,
* devices that interact with citizens with reduced rights, e.g. prisoners.

An IOT BOR should therefore formally acknowledge the following roles:
* Manufacturer: assembled the device, likely responsible for the software it contains
* Service Provider: provides internet services, e.g. data aggregation, to a class of devices
* Owner: owns and controls a device
* User: interacts deliberately with a device; anyone supplying Personally Identifying Information (PII) is a User
* Public: interacts with a device without knowledge or consent

Draft Bill of Rights:
* Open is better than closed; this ensures portability between Internet of Things devices.
* Users, not Owners, Manufacturers or Service Providers, own PII collected by devices
* Device Owners, not Manufacturers or Service Providers, own non-PII information collected by devices.
* Devices that collect data from the Public must share that data publicly (preferably reasonable and non-discriminatory terms with no claim of copyright)
* All interactions between the Public and a device must be anonymous.
* Users shall control the retention, use and publication of all personally identifying information (PII).
* Users should control the retention, use and publication of non-PII information gathered by devices.
* Users shall have the right to obtain a copy of all information, gathered by a device, pertaining to that user.
* Users shall have the right to refuse interaction with a device.
* Owners shall control the retention, use a publication of information, except where a User right (above) preempts this right.
* Owners shall have full control over software that executes on devices that they own.
* Owners shall control all cryptographic keys associated with devices that they own.
* Users should have the right to demand proof of integrity of a device, e.g. a certificate chain describing the loaded software.
* Let us take responsibility together for building systems that are easier to use for good and harder to use maliciously
